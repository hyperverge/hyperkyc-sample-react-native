Integration steps to create workflow and start jamming :

## Installation

HyperKyc npm plugin is available on npmjs - `[react-native-hyperkyc-sdk](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-hyperkyc-sdk)`

Run the following command in your react-native project directory

```bash
npm install react-native-hyperkyc-sdk
```

## Android Setup

1. Make sure that the minimum SDK version is 21 or higher
2. Enable¬†`multidex`
3. Open¬†`android/build.gradle`¬†file and add the following lines inside `allprojects` function

```groovy
allprojects {
    repositories {
        google()
        mavenCentral()
        maven {
						url = "s3://hvsdk/android/releases"
            credentials(AwsCredentials) {
                accessKey = "aws_access_key" // get this from the team
                secretKey = "aws_secret_pass"// get this from the team
            }
        }
    }
}
```

1. Sync the project

## iOS Setup

1. `cd` to iOS directory and run `pod install` 
2. Add Camera Permissions to request the user for camera permissions, add this key-value pair in your application's info.plist file.
    - **Key :**¬†Privacy - Camera Usage Description
    - **Value :**¬†"Access to camera is needed for document and face capture"

## Integrate HyperKyc React Native SDK

1. Create a workflow config dictionary in order to launch the HyperKYC SDK from react-native
    
    ```tsx
    import { NativeModules } from 'react-native';
    const { Hyperkyc } = NativeModules
    
    // ...
    
       var configDictionary = {};
              configDictionary["appId"] = appID
              configDictionary["appKey"] = appKey
    											or 
              configDictionary["accessToken"] = accessToken
              
              var inputsDictionary = {};
              inputsDictionary["bvnNumber"] = "number-123"
              inputsDictionary["image"] = "image-path"
         
              
              configDictionary["inputs"] = inputsDictionary
              configDictionary["transactionId"] = transactionId
              configDictionary["workflowId"] = "workflow-id"
    ```
    
    In order to use the SDK, you can either use `appId`, `appKey` flow or the `accessToken` flow
    
    1. appId (`appId`) & appKey (`appKey`) Flow: 
        - `appKey`
            - AppKey that is given to you in order to use the Hyperverge‚Äôs SDK
        - `appId`
            - AppID that is given to you in order to use the Hyperverge‚Äôs SDK.
    2.  `accessToken`
        - accessToken can be generated by using [this](https://www.notion.so/HyperKyc-GKYC-React-Native-947a7d4923734344918611858e311130) section
    3. `transactionId` (Mandatory)
        - The transactionId that has to be used when the SDK tries to create an user session for every KYC flow.

        5.  `workflowId` (Mandatory)

- The workflowId that is used to fetch the custom workflow config for the appId. This can be obtained from Hyperverge Dashboard.

1.  Launch HyperKyc
    
     
    
    ```
    //  Launch HyperKyc using launch() function
         Hyperkyc.launch(configDictionary, function(result){
                   console.log(result)
               })
    
    ```
